# Safe_RL

<h2> This repository contains my work on Safe-RL as a student. The <a href = "https://github.com/johannah/bootstrap_dqn">implementation of boostrap DQN by Johanna</a> was taken as a reference to build the code for my project.</h2>

<h3> All the code files are in the code folder while the results for each environment are under its own heading. </h3>
