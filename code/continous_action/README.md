<p> This section of the code is for continous actions environments like Mujoco. I have built my algorithm on top fo soft actor critic model. </p>

<p> To run a simple ensemble of soft actor critc RL agents use the file main.py by giving the appropriate arguments.</p>

<p> To run a the Safe RL agent use the file main_safe.py by giving the appropriate arguments and path to your baseline.</p>
